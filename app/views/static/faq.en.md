##What is bountyhill?

Everyone knows the pieces of paper sticking at trees, traffic lights and lanterns, on which someone offers a reward while looking for an apartment, a stolen bicycle or even a witness. Many of these search ads are unsuccessful because they remain unnoticed.

On bountyhill we offer you a service to publish your personal search request in the internet without any hassle. In addition you can post your request into several social networks to increase the reach of your search even further.

Of course you can also offer on published search requests of other users on bountyhill. Since these requests are always associated with a reward for a successful fulfillment, you can earn real money with a matching offer.

##How does the integration of social networks work?
bountyhill has its own accounts in all known social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and LinkedIn. Your search is shared within these networks automatically after its publication.

In addition, you can decide whether we should post your search via your account on your own networks. Your to bountyhill known networks are preselected in the publishing form to do so. The selection of other networks (with subsequent authentication) is unproblematically just like the deselection of the pre-selected ones.

##How do I make an offer for a search request?
Please answer with the bountyhill offer form as detailed as possible and specify the fulfillment of the given criteria. A detailed offer motivates the searcher to accept your offer on bountyhill. Until the offer is accepted you can withdraw your offer at any time and without further ado.

Once you have posted your offer, we will inform the searcher about it. In addition, he will find your offer in his personal area of the website. Now it is up to the searcher whether he'll accepted, rejected, or comment your offer or if he'll contact you via our contact option. For the later we will arrange the exchange of your email addresses by mutual agreement.

If the searcher accepts your offer you might commit yourself legally binding to it. Therefore you should only make offers you can satisfy.

##What are "BountyPoints"?
bountyhill is a startup from Berlin, we are part of the social network community. Whether or not bountyhill will be successful depends mainly on you, our users. Therefore we have launched our free rewarding program "BountyPoints" to let our most active users participate in our success. 
Each registered user is automatically added to our rewards program. Almost any  activity on bountyhill results in BountyPoints being credited to your account. The following actions will be credited with the corresponding number of BountyPoints:

** Interaction **               | ** Points **
:-------------------------------| ------:
Account / Identity added        | 3
Identity deleted                | -3
Search request published        | 5
Others request shared           | 1
Offer submitted                 | 5
Offer accepted                  | 3
Search/offer commented          | 1
Search/offer withdrawn          | -5
<br>

On your profile page you can find a list of the BountyPoints collected by you so far.

We would like to thank our most active users and reward their support. After the closing of each fiscal year bountyhill will therefore distribute 10% of its net profit to its 100 most active users. This reward will be paid proportionately according to the number of collected BountyPoints by these users.

Until we can report a net profit for a fiscal year, we will collect your BountyPoints on your account for you. So they will stay valuable until the first dividend can be paid out.
